# About

There are lots of free and premium tools for testers outhere. We cannot learn them all. What you can is to be aware that they exist so when you need a tool you can choose wisely. I believe that it would be good to not only read someone's article or watch video tutorial but also try out the tool yourself to get at least some hands-on experience. That's why I started adding short demos of test automation tools I stumbled upon which looked interesting to me. It also helps me to remember new things and improve my technical skills. Feel free to have a look and ask questions.
